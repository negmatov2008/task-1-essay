          The map provides a layout of the public park when it first opened in
          1920 and the same park today.

          Overall, Grange Park, especially to relax from the clear landscape,
          has many seats for sitting and musical areas for singing songs in the
          past and today.

          In 1920, this park included many seats and rose gardens around the
          ground of the park, so there was a lot of disorder in the park. And
          this park had two main things. There was a small stage for musicians
          and a beautiful fountain. You could enter this park from two main
          entrances; their names were Arnold Avenue and Eldon Street.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, this park is better than before and very modern. You can see
          only two rose gardens, which have been added to this park. There is a
          cafe, a childrenâ€™s play area, and a big water feature in Grange Park.
          And the stage for musicians has become a modern amphitheater for
          concerts, but you cannot see a fountain. This place has a rose garden
          and is surrounded by seats. The two entrances do not change, but an
          underground car park entrance is pushed to Grange Park.
